# RPShare

A client-side Fabric mod and server-side Paper plugin that allows players to quickly share resource packs using written books

Client and server work separately with the same book format. You can install only one of those or both

Requiers [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin) and [owo lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib) on the client and [MCKotlin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/mckotlin) on the server

## Create a special book

First page should start with `#RPShare` keyword and contain a direct download link for a resource pack

You can also add a description on the second page

Don't forget to sign the book. Any title would be okay


## Download using client-side mod

Opening a book marked with `#RPShare` will result in  a new menu

If you click on `Download` the mod then will download the resourcepack, put it into the usual `resourcepacks` folder and immediately activate it



## Using server-side plugin

Server-side plugin doesn't really do much. It only makes it so that you can click on the link and changes the formatting a little bit. Slightly more convenient for players who don't want to use the mod
